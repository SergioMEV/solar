### Task 1: Read: 

- whenever a client receives the message or the sever reads a file 
- store lines of words into array (indexed by line number)
- line length, and number of lines can be fixed right now

### Task 2: Write

- When the server shuts down, the server saves all the lines into a txt file 

### Task 3: UI implementation using ncurses library
